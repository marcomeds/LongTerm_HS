\item \textit{Notes}: Odd columns report the control (not assigned to an elite school) mean, standard deviation of the mean (in parentheses), and number of observations in the control group (in square brackets). Even columns report the treatment effect (difference between those assigned to an elite school and those who are not), the standard error of the effect (in parentheses), and number of observations in the treatment group (in square brackets). Columns 1--2 focus on the sample around 1 point from the cutoff.  Columns 3--4 focus on the sample around 2 point from the cutoff.  Columns 5--6 focus on the sample around 3 point from the cutoff.  All differences control for the probability of being assigned to an elite school by the assignment mechanisms following \citet{abdulkadirouglu2022breaking}. Statistical significance at the 1, 5, 10\% levels is indicated by \sym{***}, \sym{**}, and \sym{*}.
